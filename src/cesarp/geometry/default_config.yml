GEOMETRY:
    NEIGHBOURHOOD:
        RADIUS:                     100  # meter; within this radius buildings around the main building are used as shading objects
        MAX_DISTANCE_ADJACENCY:     0.1  # meter; if the distance between two buildings is below this threshold they are considered to be adjacent (no windows, different properties for wall)

    MAIN_BLDG_SHAPE:
        MINIMAL_STORY_HEIGHT:          2.4  # meter; minimal floor height; if the building height is not dividable by 2.4, the floor height is rounded up
        WINDOW:
            HEIGHT:                         1.5  # meter; fixed height for a window, width is set to match specified glazing ratio
            MIN_WALL_WIDTH_FOR_WINDOW:      0.1  # meter; if a wall is smaller than this threshold no window is modelled
            MIN_WINDOW_WIDTH:               0.08 # meter; if a window would be smaller than this threshold it is not modelled
            MAX_GLZ_RATIO_WALL_WIDTH:       0.95 # factor [0..1]; if window width calculated is wider then this fraction of the wall, then reduce the window width to wall width * MAX_GLZ_RATIO_FACTOR_WIN_WIDTH. this avoids windows which are wider than the wall.
            WINDOW_FRAME:
                WIDTH: 0.04                  # meter; fixed width for the windows frames
        GLAZING_RATIO_CHECK:  # check if overall building ratio is equal to set per-wall building ratio
            ALLOWED_GLZ_RATIO_DEV: 0.02  # percentage deviation allowed between the set glazing ratio applied per wall and the resulting overall building glazing ratio
            EXCEPTION_ON_MISMATCH: True  # raise exception if glazing ratio mismatch is out of allowed deviation, if false only do only log as a warning
            DO_CHECK_BLD_WITH_ADJACENCIES: False  # if true, check is also on if some of the walls of the building are adjacent and thus have no windows
